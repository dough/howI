<h1>GitHub</h1>
<ul>
	GitHub has long been the place where software developers
	shared their work
	
	Recently they have made it available for websites that are to
	be used for sharing information and projects in general,
	in particular for personal websites.

	Once you have obtained  username in GitHub you can set up
	a repository username.github.io, and that will make a website
	http[s]://username.github.io automatically available. There
	are then various ways to set up other repositories for projects
	if you wish.
