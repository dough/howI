<h1>How I</h1>
<ul>
<li>
	About this site, or something else specifically configured for my setting.
	Or it might be software or something that I wrote. This serves as a substitute
	for my memory when I wonder what to do.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="workspots.html">worksites</a>
	There are two workstations here. One is a Lenovo IdeaPad (portable) which dual-boots
	either Ubuntu 18.04 (usually) or Windows 10. The other is a  Lenovo IdeaCentre which boots Windows 10 but 
	has Ubuntu 18.0 installed under "Linux for Windows".
</li>
<li>
	<a href="texmaker.html">TeX</a>
	I am writing a number of mathematics papers, and using TeX to do them.
	This includes both authorind the source in .tex files, but also producing the
	bibliography, for which I use BibTeX references mostly found on Google Scholar,
	and JabRef for producing the necessary TeX documents.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="newSite.html">new site</a>
	Adding new sites.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="newFiles.html">new files</a>
