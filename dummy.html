<p>
Basically GH provides a repository whose HTML contents are displayed at <strong>dough.github.io</strong>.
</p>
<p>
We can place something into that by the local command <strong>git push</strong>.
</p>
<p>
It becomes a website organized in the usual way because we push files that refer to other files that have been or will be pushed.
</p>
<p>We can actually push as many files as we want, even (and this is often the case) an entire website with directories, images, and style files.</p>
One way to do this is just to make that site, do the command <strong>git commit -a -m “message about the new site”</strong>,
and follow that with the command <strong>git push</strong>. Bingo, it all goes up there!
