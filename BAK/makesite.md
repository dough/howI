To make a site, such as **topology**

* Create a Rrepository *https://github.com/dough/topology.*git*.

* Tell it a license to use.

* In Settings mark its publication source as the master branch.

* In the local dough/Repository do 

  git clone *https://github.com/dough/topology.git*, which creates a directory topology.


* Enter that directory and create *index.html*.
  (Suggest copying  the script **newindex** to do the following steps).

  *  vim index.html

  *  git add index.html

  *  git commit -m "new index"

  *  git push origin master
